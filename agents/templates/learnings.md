# Learnings

Staging area for observations extracted from QA review reports. PM-facing
context only - agents do not reference this file during their work. They
read `patterns.md` and `anti-patterns.md` instead.

When a learning recurs across cycles or proves significant, PM promotes
it to a numbered entry in `patterns.md` or `anti-patterns.md` and marks
it here as promoted.

## Format

```
### [date] - [source: QA review / PM observation / agent note]
[Raw observation. What happened, which stack, what was the outcome.]
Status: active / promoted to P-XXX / promoted to A-XXX
```
